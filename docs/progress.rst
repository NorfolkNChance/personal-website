Project progress
================

Captain's log stardate 95027.77.

Work on setting up continuos integration has resulted in integration of Travis CI and ReadTheDocs for the project.
A simple sample python file currently ensures the project passes, this will eventually be superseded by the project itself.
Integration of the ReadTheDocs was straight forward, this required a change to the readme file for the main github page, however, this is much better.

Next step for this project is working on the unit testing and building up the site.
